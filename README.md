# Tabatha New Tab

This is a Firefox addon and a Chrome extension that replaces the current new tab and homepage with a sleek flat black design.

The settings modal is a bit crude, but it gets the job done for enabling/disabling and configuring the temperature display.

There is a hosted copy of the same application that runs in the extension hosted on [tab.dstn.to](https://tab.dstn.to) if you would like to see what it looks like.
